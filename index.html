      </br>
      Francesco Patti moved from Sicily to the Aosta Valley to learn how to become a baker.
      </br>
      Than he met Andrea Cavallari, the current head of the patty bakery and they started a family business more than 30 years ago.
      </br>
      The secret of the success of Patti products comes from a combination of various factors: the choice of genuine top quality ingredients, passion, craftsmanship and a dough worked by hand, with love and patience, without preservatives and chemical additives.
      </br>
      Patti now has more than 50 employees and several agents, with three stores in the Biella area and a store in Milan.
      </br>
      The exquisite breadsticks and pastry products (Baci di dama, Amaretti morbidi, Canestrelli canavesani, Frollini with pine nuts, Torcetti with butter and Paste di meliga) are appreciated and distributed throughout northern Italy, up to overcome the borders reaching some selected shops in Europe.
